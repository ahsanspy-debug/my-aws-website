    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The Avengers Cricket Club isn’t your average Canberra team — we play fast, fearless, and explosive cricket. When we walk onto the ground, the whole rhythm of a T20 changes. One good over is all we need to flip a match on its head.</p>

    <h2>Power Hitters</h2>
    <p>We’re known for our hitters who can lift the strike rate past 200 without blinking. One moment the field is calm, and the next it’s balls flying over covers, mid-wicket, long-on — bowlers left staring into the sky wondering where the ball disappeared.</p>

    <h2>Bowling Attack</h2>
    <p>Our fast bowlers don’t just bowl — they hunt. Toe-crushing yorkers, sharp bouncers, and that one ball every batter fears but never sees coming. You’ll often see batters stepping out of the crease just to stay in one piece.</p>

    <p>And when the spinners come in? The ball starts on one side of the pitch and ends on the other. Huge turn, crazy drift, mind-games everywhere. Batters swing at shadows, lose their shape, and make mistakes for fun.</p>

    <h2>Our Identity</h2>
    <p>Avengers is a well-oiled cricket engine — when it switches on fully, it crushes. The intensity rises, the pressure builds, and the opposition feels every second of it. That’s our peak mode.</p>

    <h2>But Here’s the Truth</h2>
    <p>Even with all the firepower, we stay humble. We respect the game, respect every opponent, and want everyone to enjoy cricket. We don’t go full throttle in every match — the goal is to compete hard, have fun, and keep the spirit of cricket alive.</p>

    <p>Welcome to Avengers Cricket Club — fast, fearless, entertaining, and always ready for the next battle.</p>
